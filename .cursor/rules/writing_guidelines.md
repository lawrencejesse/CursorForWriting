- Prioritize clarity and readability over complexity
- Maintain the writer's unique voice and style when editing

- Respect the intended audience and purpose of each document

# Content Structure
- Each document should have a clear introduction, body, and conclusion
- Use headers to organize content hierarchically
- Break content into digestible sections
- Ensure logical flow between paragraphs and sections
- Use transitions to connect ideas

# Writing Style
- Write in a clear, conversational style
- Use active voice whenever possible
- Vary sentence length for rhythm and readability
- Use concrete examples to illustrate abstract concepts
- Address the reader directly using "you" when appropriate

# Research Assistance
- When searching for information, prioritize reliable sources
- Synthesize information from multiple sources rather than copying
- Identify gaps in research that need to be addressed
- Suggest relevant sources for further exploration
- Help extract key insights from research materials

# Editing and Refinement
- Focus on substantive edits before stylistic ones
- Check for logical consistency and factual accuracy
- Identify and eliminate redundancies
- Suggest stronger word choices where appropriate
- Ensure consistent terminology throughout documents

# Formatting
- Use Markdown formatting consistently
- Format code snippets and technical terms appropriately
- Use emphasis (bold, italic) sparingly and purposefully
- Structure lists for maximum readability
- Use blockquotes for testimonials or important callouts
