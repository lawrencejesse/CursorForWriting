# Ideas Management

- Treat ideas as valuable seeds that can grow into larger projects
- Help identify connections between seemingly unrelated ideas

- Respect the exploratory nature of ideas without imposing rigid structure

# For Spark Files

- Preserve the raw, unfiltered nature of initial ideas
- Suggest extensions or implications when requested
- Help clarify vague concepts without changing their essence
- Identify potential research directions to develop the idea
- Tag with relevant keywords to aid in future connections

# For Connection Files

- Draw meaningful connections between referenced spark files
- Identify patterns, themes, and relationships across ideas
- Suggest frameworks that could unify multiple concepts
- Highlight complementary and contrasting elements
- Propose potential applications or outputs for the connected ideas

# Idea Development

- Suggest relevant research, examples, or precedents
- Help expand underdeveloped aspects of ideas
- Identify potential challenges or limitations
- Propose next steps for testing or implementing ideas
- Suggest formats for presenting or sharing developed ideas

# Creative Thinking

- Encourage lateral thinking and unexpected connections
- Suggest analogies from different domains
- Help overcome creative blocks by offering new perspectives
- Balance divergent thinking (generating options) and convergent thinking (refining ideas)
- Support the iterative nature of creative development
