nnnnnnnnn;'[,ki# Ideas Repository

This directory is dedicated to capturing and developing your random thoughts, inspirations, and creative sparks.

## Directory Structure

- **sparks/**: For quick, unfiltered thoughts and ideas
  - Capture ideas as they come, without worrying about structure or completeness
  - Use timestamped filenames (e.g., `20250226_ai_storytelling.md`) for easy chronological tracking
  
- **connections/**: For exploring relationships between ideas
  - Connect multiple sparks into more developed concepts
  - Reference original spark files using the `@` symbol
  - Identify patterns and themes across your random thoughts

## How to Use This Space

### Capturing Sparks

1. When inspiration strikes, create a new file in `sparks/` with a descriptive name
2. Write freely without self-editing or worrying about structure
3. Include any relevant context, influences, or triggers for the idea
4. Tag your ideas with keywords at the bottom of the file for easier searching later

### Making Connections

Use Cursor's AI capabilities to help connect your ideas:

1. **Discover patterns**: 
   ```
   @ideas/sparks/
   
   Review these idea sparks and identify any recurring themes, patterns, or potential connections between them.
   ```

2. **Develop a specific idea**:
   ```
   @ideas/sparks/specific_idea.md
   
   Help me develop this idea further. What are some potential applications, extensions, or implications?
   ```

3. **Connect multiple ideas**:
   ```
   @ideas/sparks/idea1.md
   @ideas/sparks/idea2.md
   
   These ideas seem related. Help me explore how they might connect or complement each other.
   ```

4. **Create a synthesis document**:
   ```
   @ideas/sparks/idea1.md
   @ideas/sparks/idea2.md
   @ideas/sparks/idea3.md
   
   Create a new document that synthesizes these related ideas into a cohesive concept or framework.
   ```
