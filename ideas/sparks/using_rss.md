# Using Rss
so i have never used rss before, and i don't know of many people who do, but i know that it can pull content from my favourite sources. 
what if i used it to pull content, and rather than it going into my email (i.e. newsletters i subscribe to), it would just go to my cursor second brain?

This would feed it into my ai "second brain" i don't neccessarily have to read it all but my ai would have it as context. Also if my ai cited it, or refered to it, i would have it right there, easy for me to read and better understand.
i'm sure i could also use ai in the rss feed thing to make sure i'm only downloading stuff that is relevant to me, or even sort and categorize it by topic.
