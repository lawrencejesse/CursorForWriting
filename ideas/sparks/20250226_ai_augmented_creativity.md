# AI-Augmented Creativity Cycles

Date: 2025-02-26

## The Spark
What if we thought about AI-assisted writing not as a linear process but as a cyclical one? The writer generates ideas, the AI expands and connects them, the writer refines and redirects, and the cycle continues—each revolution producing more nuanced and interesting work.

## Context
Was reading about iterative design processes in product development and realized the same principles could apply to AI-assisted writing. The traditional writing process (draft → edit → revise) becomes more fluid and cyclical with AI in the loop.

## Potential
This could lead to a new framework for creative collaboration with AI:
- Rapid ideation cycles
- Unexpected connections between concepts
- Breaking through creative blocks by outsourcing expansion
- Maintaining human direction while leveraging AI's associative capabilities

Could be especially useful for complex projects where the structure isn't clear from the beginning.

## Questions
- How many cycles are optimal before diminishing returns?
- What's the right balance of human vs. AI contribution at each stage?
- How do we prevent the process from becoming an echo chamber?
- Could this approach be formalized into a teachable method?
- How would this change the way we attribute creative work?
