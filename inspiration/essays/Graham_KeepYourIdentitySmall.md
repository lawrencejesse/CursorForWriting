**Why It Matters:** This essay fundamentally changed how I think about identity and why certain topics (politics, religion) are so difficult to discuss rationally. The concept of keeping your identity small has helped me remain more open-minded and engage with ideas rather than defending positions.

I finally realized today why politics and religion yield such uniquely useless discussions.

As a rule, any mention of religion on an online forum degenerates into a religious argument. Why? Why does this happen with religion and not with Javascript or baking or other topics people talk about on forums?

What's different about religion is that people don't feel they need to have any particular expertise to have opinions about it. All they need is strongly held beliefs, and anyone can have those. No thread about Javascript will grow as fast as one about religion, because people feel they have to be over some threshold of expertise to post comments about that. But on religion everyone's an expert.

Then it struck me: this is the problem with politics too. Politics, like religion, is a topic where there's no threshold of expertise for expressing an opinion. All you need is strong convictions.

Do religion and politics have something in common that explains this similarity? One possible explanation is that they deal with questions that have no definite answers, so there's no back pressure on people's opinions. Since no one can be proven wrong, every opinion is equally valid, and sensing this, everyone lets fly with theirs.

But this isn't true. There are certainly some political questions that have definite answers, like how much a new government policy will cost. But the more precise political questions suffer the same fate as the vaguer ones.

I think what religion and politics have in common is that they become part of people's identity, and people can never have a fruitful argument about something that's part of their identity. By definition they're partisan.

Which topics engage people's identity depends on the people, not the topic. For example, a discussion about a battle that included citizens of one of the countries involved would probably degenerate into a political argument. But a discussion today about a battle that took place in the Bronze Age probably wouldn't. No one would know which side to be on. So it's not politics that's the source of the trouble, but identity. When people say a discussion has degenerated into a religious war, what they really mean is that it has started to be driven mostly by people's identities.

Because the point at which this happens depends on the people rather than the topic, it's a mistake to conclude that because a question tends to provoke religious wars, it must have no answer. For example, the question of whether God exists hasn't been settled, but the fact that this question leads to religious wars doesn't mean it has no answer.

It's just the nature of identity that it takes time to separate it from what it's attached to. And in particular it takes time to separate it from other people. A part of growing up is learning to differentiate yourself from your parents. Until this happens your identity consists of the intersection of your interests and your parents'.

Unfortunately, people don't seem to separate themselves from various forms of identity as they grow up. The rank-and-file football fan is probably not aware that his opinions about football are guided by his identification with his team. But why should this be so different from religion or politics?

What's different about religion and politics is that today, people don't seem to be able to separate them from their identities. I suspect the problem is exacerbated by the fact that we physically segregate ourselves according to identity. It probably makes it harder to keep your identity small when you're surrounded by people who have the same one.

The most intriguing thing about this theory, if it's right, is that it explains not merely which kinds of discussions to avoid, but how to have better ideas. If people can't think clearly about anything that has become part of their identity, then all other things being equal, the best plan is to let as few things into your identity as possible.

Most people reading this will already be fairly tolerant. But there is a step beyond thinking of yourself as x but tolerating y: not even to consider yourself an x. The more labels you have for yourself, the dumber they make you.

## My Notes

This essay introduced me to the concept that the strength with which we hold an opinion should be proportional to the evidence we have for it. When something becomes part of our identity, we defend it regardless of evidence.

Key insights:
- The more something is tied to your identity, the harder it is to think rationally about it
- This applies beyond just religion and politics to any topic that becomes part of who you think you are
- The solution isn't just tolerance but actively working to keep your identity small
- Labels we apply to ourselves limit our thinking

I've found this particularly useful when discussing contentious topics. Asking "Is this part of my identity?" helps me recognize when I'm defending a position rather than seeking truth.

## Related Ideas

- @ideas/sparks/20250226_cognitive_load_writing.md - There's a connection here to cognitive load. When something is part of our identity, it creates additional cognitive load when discussing it because we're simultaneously processing the topic AND defending our sense of self.

- Reminds me of the concept of "steelmanning" arguments - the opposite of strawmanning, where you try to formulate the strongest possible version of an opposing view.
